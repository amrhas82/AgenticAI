# Streamlit Installation Fix

## Problem
Streamlit was not installed, causing the error:
```
nohup: failed to run command 'streamlit': No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
1. Python packages were not installed
2. pip3 command was not properly detected
3. Streamlit was installed to `~/.local/bin/` which was not in PATH

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed All Python Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Successfully installed:
- streamlit 1.50.0
- ollama 0.1.7
- pypdf2 3.0.1
- python-dotenv 1.0.0
- requests 2.31.0
- numpy 2.3.3
- openai 2.0.1
- python-docx 1.1.0
- And all dependencies

### 2. Updated Scripts to Use Correct Paths

**Updated `menu.sh`:**
- Changed `pip3` to `python3 -m pip` for better compatibility
- Added logic to find streamlit in `$HOME/.local/bin/streamlit`
- Fixed troubleshooting command to use `python3 -m pip`

**Updated `run_local.sh`:**
- Changed `pip3` to `python3 -m pip`
- Added automatic detection of streamlit location
- Fallback to full path: `$HOME/.local/bin/streamlit`

### 3. Verified Installation
✅ Streamlit version: 1.50.0
✅ Streamlit location: `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/streamlit`
✅ Test start: Successfully started and stopped
✅ No syntax errors in `src/app.py`

## How to Use Now

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
./run_local.sh
```

### Option 2: Using Menu
```bash
./menu.sh
# Select option 4: Start Services (Native Mode)
```

### Option 3: Manual
```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve &

# Start Streamlit
$HOME/.local/bin/streamlit run src/app.py --server.port=8501
```

## Verification

All services now working:
- ✅ Python 3.13.3 installed
- ✅ pip installed (via `python3 -m pip`)
- ✅ Ollama 0.12.3 installed and running
- ✅ Streamlit 1.50.0 installed
- ✅ All Python dependencies installed

## Next Steps

1. **Install a model** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   ```

2. **Start the services**:
   ```bash
   ./run_local.sh
   ```

3. **Access the UI**:
   - Open browser to: http://localhost:8501
