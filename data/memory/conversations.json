Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Clone the repository**: The first step is to clone the Klavis AI repository from GitHub. You can do this by opening your terminal and typing the following command:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis.git\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `klavis` in your current working directory, which contains all the files and folders needed to run McP. \ud83d\udcbb\n2. **Install dependencies**: Before you can start using McP, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\nThis will install all the required Node.js packages, including Express, Passport, and MongoDB. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3. **Set up MongoDB**: McP relies on MongoDB to store user data, so you need to set it up. Create a new directory called `data` inside the `klavis` directory, and then run the following command to create a new MongoDB database:\n```bash\nmongod --dbpath data\n```\nThis will start the MongoDB server and create a new database with the name `data`. \ud83d\udcda\n4. **Create the McP database**: Next, you need to create the McP database within MongoDB. Navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nphp db.create.js\n```\nThis will create the McP database with the necessary collections for storing user data. \ud83d\udccb\n5. **Start the McP server**: To start the McP server, navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\nThis will start the McP server on port 3000 by default. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. \ud83d\ude80\n6. **Configure McP**: Finally, you need to configure McP by editing the `config.json` file inside the `klavis` directory. This file contains settings for McP, such as the database connection, server port, and more. You can customize these settings according to your needs. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should now have a self-hosted McP instance up and running on your machine. Happy chatting! \ud83d\ude0a"

Navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\nThis will install all the required Node.js packages, including Express, Passport, and MongoDB. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3. **Set up MongoDB**: McP relies on MongoDB to store user data, so you need to set it up. Create a new directory called `data` inside the `klavis` directory, and then run the following command to create a new MongoDB database:\n```bash\nmongod --dbpath data\n```\nThis will start the MongoDB server and create a new database with the name `data`. \ud83d\udcda\n4. **Create the McP database**: Next, you need to create the McP database within MongoDB. Navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nphp db.create.js\n```\nThis will create the McP database with the necessary collections for storing user data. \ud83d\udccb\n5. **Start the McP server**: To start the McP server, navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\nThis will start the McP server on port 3000 by default. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. \ud83d\ude80\n6. **Configure McP**: Finally, you need to configure McP by editing the `config.json` file inside the `klavis` directory. This file contains settings for McP, such as the database connection, server port, and more. You can customize these settings according to your needs. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should now have a self-hosted McP instance up and running on your machine. Happy chatting! \ud83d\ude0a"

          "content": "\nHello! I'm here to help you with your question. So, you want to know how to set up a self-hosted McP from the Klavis AI GitHub repository? \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcbb\n\nGreat! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Clone the repository**: The first step is to clone the Klavis AI repository from GitHub. You can do this by opening your terminal and typing the following command:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis.git\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `klavis` in your current working directory, which contains all the files and folders needed to run McP. \ud83d\udcbb\n2. **Install dependencies**: Before you can start using McP, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\nThis will install all the required Node.js packages, including Express, Passport, and MongoDB. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3. **Set up MongoDB**: McP relies on MongoDB to store user data, so you need to set it up. Create a new directory called `data` inside the `klavis` directory, and then run the following command to create a new MongoDB database:\n```bash\nmongod --dbpath data\n```\nThis will start the MongoDB server and create a new database with the name `data`. \ud83d\udcda\n4. **Create the McP database**: Next, you need to create the McP database within MongoDB. Navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nphp db.create.js\n```\nThis will create the McP database with the necessary collections for storing user data. \ud83d\udccb\n5. **Start the McP server**: To start the McP server, navigate to the `klavis` directory and run the following command:\n```bash\nnode server.js\n```\nThis will start the McP server on port 3000 by default. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. \ud83d\ude80\n6. **Configure McP**: Finally, you need to configure McP by editing the `config.json` file inside the `klavis` directory. This file contains settings for McP, such as the database connection, server port, and more. You can customize these settings according to your needs. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should now have a self-hosted McP instance up and running on your machine. Happy chatting! \ud83d\ude0a"

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to install and set up a machine learning environment.\n\nTo start, you'll need to have a few tools installed:\n\n1. Python: MCP requires Python 3.8 or later. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.\n2. Jupyter Notebook: MCP is built on top of Jupyter Notebook. You'll need to have Jupyter installed on your system.\n\nHere are some general steps to install and set up a machine learning environment:\n\n**Method 1: Using pip (recommended)**\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n2. Install the `mcp` package using pip:\n```\npip install mcp\n```\n3. Follow the instructions in the MCP documentation to create an account on the Klavis AI platform and download the required files.\n\n**Method 2: Using conda (if you have Anaconda)**\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n2. Install the `mcp` package using conda:\n```\nconda install -c klavis mcp\n```\n3. Follow the instructions in the MCP documentation to create an account on the Klavis AI platform and download the required files.\n\nAfter installing MCP, you can use it to run machine learning models in Jupyter Notebook:\n\n1. Launch a new Jupyter Notebook.\n2. Install any additional packages needed for your model using `!pip install`.\n3. Run your model using `mcp` or `jupyter notebook --mcp`.\n\nPlease note that the installation process may vary depending on your system and Python version.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you."
